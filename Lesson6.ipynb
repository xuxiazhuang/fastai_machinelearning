    "Generalization is where I say okay, here is a model that can predict cats from dogs. I’ve looked at five pictures of cats and five pictures of dogs, and I’ve built a model that is perfect. Then I look at a different set of five cats and dogs, and it gets them all wrong. So in that case, what it learned was not the difference between a cat and a dog, but it learnt what those five exact cats looked like and what those five exact dogs looked like. Or I built a model of predicting grocery sales for a particular product, so for toilet rolls in New Jersey last month, and then I go and put it into production and it scales great (in other words, a great latency, no high CPU load) but it fails to predicting anything other than toilet rolls in New Jersey. It also turns out it only did it well for last month, not the next month. So these are all generalization failures.\n",

    "Google realized that the objective was to show the most relevant search result; for other companies, it might be increasing profit, improving the customer experience, finding the best path for a robot, or balancing the load in a data center. Once we have specified the goal, the second step is to specify what inputs of the system we can control, the levers we can pull to influence the final outcome. In Google’s case, they could control the ranking of the search results. The third step was to consider what new data they would need to produce such a ranking; they realized that the implicit information regarding which pages linked to which other pages could be used for this purpose. Only after these first three steps do we begin thinking about building the predictive models. Our objective and available levers, what data we already have and what additional data we will need to collect, determine the models we can build. The models will take both the levers and any uncontrollable variables as their inputs; the outputs from the models can be combined to predict the final state for our objective."

    "Lead prioritization is a really interesting one. Every one of these boxes I’m showing, you can generally find a company or many companies whose sole job in life is to build models of that thing. So there are lots of companies that sell lead prioritization systems but again the question is how would we use that information. So if it’s like our best lead is Jeremy, he is a highest probability of buying. Does that mean I should send a salesperson out to Jeremy or I shouldn’t? If he’s highly probable to buy, why I waste my time with him. So again, you really want some kind of simulation that says what’s the likely change in Jeremy’s behavior if I send my best salesperson out to go and encourage him to sign. I think there are many many opportunities for data scientists in the world today to move beyond predictive modeling to actually bringing it all together."
